# Functional specification

The vision behind this project is create an F# library that could allow a developper/artist to "program their music".
This sound synthesizer should allow its users to easily read, create, modify, listen to and save sounds usable for musical purposes as well as do the same to an entire list of said sounds.

The final product should be useful for a musician to easily synthetise and compose music.

The final product should also be capable of applying a list of basic dilters and special effects to the sounds used by the application.
