# Functional specification

It's a schhol project made by the demand of [ALGOSUP](https://www.algosup.com/index.html)

## Requirement ?

In order to help developers who use the .NET Framework to create software using sound, we needed to create a good tool, so we created a library to meet this demand, we thought about the best programming language to make it, and we think that F# was the best to make it work in the most optimal way answer this request

## What is it ? 

The objective of the project is to create a library capable of sound synthetisation.

The final product must be capable of creating and modifying a large range of musical notes as well as applying a variety of filters and special effects upon them, (Details below) make an frequency analysis of them and save it.

The library must also contain the functionnalities necessary to importing/exporting wav and mp3 files.

## Who is our targeted audience ?

This library is mainly meant to be used by developpers for both artistic and software developpement purposes.

## MVP

The Minimum Viable Product must be capable of creating musical notes from an inputed octave[^1] and note[^2].
The saving and loading of .wav files must also be possible at this stage.

## Detailed functionnality list

The library can create, save and play sound from the code, apply filters and make a frequency analysis of your waves

## Use cases

You can use our libraries if you want to create sound make in language using the .NET framework

## Definitions

[^1]: Octaves: A series of eight notes occupying the interval between (and including) two notes, one having twice or half the frequency of vibration of the other.

[^2]: Notes: A note is a symbol denoting a musical sound.
